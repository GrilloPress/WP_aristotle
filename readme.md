Education and development tracker theme built for WordPress

## Concept

A simple WordPress theme/app which lets a small group of users to create posts. Each post is an activity. Each post contains:

- Time and date
- Title
- Category
- Content (Notes, explanation)

This aims to show the teaching/learning activity around a single child.

## Dashboard

The app has a simple summary dashboard which features:

- type of recent teaching activity, represented in a pie chart
- consecutive days
- stream/feed of recent activity
- link to day and monthly archives of activity

Within that, each day/month/year archive page should also illustrate the summary. So a day will summarize the activity within that.
